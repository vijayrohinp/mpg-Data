# mpg-Data
Basic analysis and modelling

Objective: "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

Attribute Information:

1. mpg: continuous 
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete 
3. displacement: continuous 
4. horsepower: continuous 
5. weight: continuous 
6. acceleration: continuous 
7. model year: multi-valued discrete 
8. origin: multi-valued discrete 
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)
